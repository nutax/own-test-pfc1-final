            "response": "The problem states that Zoe bought two coloring books, one with 44 pictures and the other with 44 pictures as well. After one week, she had already colored 20 of the pictures. We need to find out how many pictures she still has to color.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We can add the number of pictures in both the coloring books and then subtract the number of pictures Zoe has already colored. This will give us the number of pictures she still has to color.\n\nSo, the plan to solve this problem is:\n\n1. Add the number of pictures in both the coloring books.\n2. Subtract the number of pictures Zoe has already colored.\n3. The result will be the number of pictures she still has to color.\n\nNow, let's carry out the plan and solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. The number of pictures in both the coloring books is 44 + 44 = 88.\n2. Zoe has already colored 20 pictures.\n3. So, the number of pictures she still has to color is 88 - 20 = 68.\n\nTherefore, Zoe still has to color 68 pictures.",

            "response": "The problem is asking us to find out how much money Edward ended up with after starting his lawn mowing business in the spring and summer. We are given that he made 2 dollars in the spring and 27 dollars in the summer, but he also had to spend 5 dollars on supplies. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following plan:\n\n1. Add up the amount of money Edward made in the spring and summer.\n2. Subtract the cost of supplies from the total amount of money he made.\n3. The result will be the amount of money Edward ended up with.\n\nUsing this plan, we can solve the problem as follows:\n\n1. Edward made 2 dollars in the spring and 27 dollars in the summer, so the total amount of money he made is 2 + 27 = 29 dollars.\n2. Edward spent 5 dollars on supplies, so we need to subtract this from the total amount of money he made: 29 - 5 = 24 dollars.\n3. Therefore, Edward ended up with 24 dollars after starting his lawn mowing business.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is that Edward ended up with 24 dollars after starting his lawn mowing business.",

Zoe used 7 cups of flour for each brownie, so she needs 6 x 7 = 42 cups of flour for the remaining brownies.\n3. Zoe has already used some flour, so we need to subtract the amount used from the total needed: 42 cups - (5 brownies x 7 cups each) = 7 cups of flour still needed.\n\nTherefore, Zoe still needs 7 cups of flour to bake the remaining 6 brownies for her party.",
