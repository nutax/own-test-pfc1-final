            "response": "Plan:\n1. Start with the current number of dogwood trees in the park, which is 7.\n2. Add the number of dogwood trees the workers will plant today, which is 3.\n3. Add the number of dogwood trees the workers will plant tomorrow, which is 2.\n4. The total number of dogwood trees in the park after the workers are finished will be the sum of the current number of dogwood trees and the number of dogwood trees the workers will plant.\n\nSolution:\n1. Current number of dogwood trees = 7\n2. Number of dogwood trees workers will plant today = 3\n3. Number of dogwood trees workers will plant tomorrow = 2\n4. Total number of dogwood trees in the park after the workers are finished = 7 + 3 + 2 = 12\n\nTherefore, the park will have 12 dogwood trees when the workers are finished planting.",

The total number of orchid bushes will be divided by the number of workers to find out how many orchid bushes each worker planted.\n3. Finally, multiply the number of orchid bushes each worker planted by the total number of workers to find out the total number of orchid bushes in the park.\n\nSolution:\n1. Total number of orchid bushes = 47 + 37 + 25 = 109\n2. Number of orchid bushes each worker planted = 109/35 = 3.11 (rounded to two decimal places)\n3. Total number of orchid bushes in the park = 3.11 x 35 = 109.1 (rounded to one decimal place)\n\nTherefore, the park will have 109 orchid bushes when the workers are finished.",
